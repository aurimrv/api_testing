## Repository Structure

### 1. `PythonScript.py`
- **Description**: Main script that implements the generation and refinement of test suites using the OpenAI API.  
- **Objective**: Automates the creation and optimization of tests based on different prompt versions.

---

### 2. `EMB Projects`
- **Description**: Folder containing the EvoMaster Benchmark ([EMB](https://github.com/WebFuzzing/EMB)) projects.  
- **Modifications**:  
  - The configurations have been adapted to enable integration with `PythonScript.py`.

---

### 3. `Full Experiment Data`
- **Description**: Contains detailed tables with data from each test suite generation.  
- **Organization**:  
  - The results are organized by prompt version.  
  - Metrics include code coverage, token consumption, and execution time.

---

### 4. `Generated Tests`
- **Description**: Repository of all files generated during the execution of EvoMaster and `PythonScript.py`.  
- **Subfolders sample**:  
  1. **EvoMaster**:  
     - **Location**: `market-test-set/evomaster/`  
     - **Description**: Contains test and coverage files for each of the 10 EvoMaster executions using seeds 01 to 10.  
  2. **OpenAI GPT (PythonScript)**:  
     - **Location**: `market-test-set/gpt/v0/gpt35/`  
     - **Description**: Contains test and coverage files generated by `PythonScript.py` using the **GPT-3.5 Turbo** model and prompt version **v0**.  
     - **Executions**: Results from 3 runs (run01, run02, and run03) for each configuration.
